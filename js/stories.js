<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Valentina's
blood-drenched hair hung in front of her face as she sat in the
interrogation room, making eye contact with Detective Strauss. 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">&quot;Okay, Ms.
Rodriguez, if you can tell me what happened, maybe I can help you.&quot;
Valentina shook her head slowly, her face splattered in red. &quot;You
can't help me, Detective.&quot; Strauss leaned forward, interlocking
his fingers over a manila folder. &quot;Ms. Rodriguez, a young man is
dead. We found you at the scene of the crime tonight. It's hard to
believe that a young, pretty woman like yourself could've had
anything to do with his murder. We're just trying to get some
answers. How did this happen? How were you involved in this?&quot; 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Valentina lifted her
bloody, cuffed hands and pulled her hair back, smearing the thick,
red substance on her forehead. A long, thick chain connected the
cuffs to the floor. &quot;You're looking at me, Detective, and you're
probably imagining what I look like without the blood all over me.
You're probably imagining how I look naked, too.&quot; Valentina
gripped the end of her sundress tightly under the table and gritted
her teeth behind her closed lips. &quot;Pretty Colombian girl who
just somehow got tangled up in a bad situation, huh?&quot; Valentina
looked over to the detective's authorization card. “I'll tell you
right now, you're looking through the wrong pair of eyes, Adam.&quot;
Detective Strauss bit his lower lip. &quot;Why don't you help me see
through the right pair of eyes? Tell me what happened.&quot; 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Valentina folded her
hands and placed them on the metallic table. &quot;My brothers were
gang members, but they weren't like most of the idiots you guys come
across. They've killed many men, but you, nor your department, have
ever caught them. They're too smart, too quick for anyone to stay on
their trail. My brothers taught me how to protect myself. They told
me to pay attention to the heartbeat of a man. I'd know his
intentions by the rate of his heartbeat, the sound of that blood
rushing through his veins, the feel of his increasing pulse... but I
got addicted to it; I sought it out. 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">“My first kill was
my mother's boyfriend. My brothers were moved out already, and he
never liked to be told no. One day, he got too familiar with her, and
I went after him. He was bigger, but the pulse in his neck drove me
wild. I squeezed and squeezed until he stopped moving. My mother
couldn't bear to see me locked up, but she couldn't look at me
anymore. 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">“I left and moved
in with friends from school. Guys would come over, and I always
stayed locked up in my room; I was afraid of it happening again. 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><span style="background: #ffffff">“One
night, I couldn't help myself. My roommate had her boyfriend over,
and he was really, <i>really</i> planning on having a good night with
her. I could hear his heart pounding... it sounded like drums calling
to me.&quot; </span>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Valentina gripped at
her dress again, pulling it up past her thighs. Strauss' eyes held
concern and confused excitement; he kept his face straight. 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><a name="_He_went_to_the_bathroom_alone"></a>
<span style="background: #ffffff">&quot;He went to the bathroom
alone, and I fought; I really tried to stay in my room, but his heart
was calling me. All that blood was circulating for <i>me</i>. When he
came out of the bathroom, I was standing in my doorway, in just my
underwear. He came in, and I had my way with him. We didn't have sex,
though his pumping, young, foolish blood cried for it! No one heard
him scream because he couldn't. Of course, I couldn't let my roommate
see what happened to him; I hid him until I had a day off to get rid
of the remains.&quot; </span>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><span style="background: #ffffff">Strauss
rubbed his hair, letting out a deep breath. &quot;So, you killed two
<i>other</i> men; tonight wasn't your first.&quot; Valentina shook
her head, smirking slightly. &quot;I've killed many... and that <i>boy</i>
you found... he wasn't my last. Ya see, men have this tendency to get
excited when they think they're about to seal the deal with a
woman... They feel powerful... until they meet <i>me</i>, and then…
they don't. </span>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">“I get a rush from
hearing their heartbeats when they're in the throes of lust, or how
some sentimentalists like to call it, 'passion'. I lured men to me
with false promises of getting their rocks off just so I could repeat
that glorious experience of getting a heart rate as high as it could
go... only to stop it... just like what I'm about to do to you,
Detective…&quot; 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Valentina jerked her
hands upward, the handcuff chains breaking from the floor. She
flipped the table and pounced onto Strauss, knocking him backward.
The manila folder spilled open, photos of a mangled, young man
scattering across the floor. She clutched her hands around his
throat. Strauss squealed in agony. &quot;How-How did you-&quot; 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">&quot;Adrenaline.&quot;</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Valentina looked
Strauss in his almost lifeless eyes. &quot;I heard your heart rate
increase when you first laid eyes on me...&quot; 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Rapid pounding came
from the door as policemen frantically tried to get in the room. 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">&quot;...when I
mentioned being naked...&quot; 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Her palms crushed
his jugular veins. &quot;...and when I lifted my dress.&quot; 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Strauss' eyes closed
slowly as his breathing ceased. Valentina drove her hand through his
chest, palming his heart. 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Policemen burst
through the door, their guns drawn at the petite, Colombian killer.
Valentina sniffed the air deeply, whispering to herself. &quot;Soooo
much blood.&quot; She set her sights on the crowd of officers and
lunged at them, their handguns spewing rounds of bullets at her,
shouts and hollers of grown men echoing throughout the police
station.</p>`

            firstSentence: `If I hadn't been
there in that same foxhole with Henry and Benny that day, I don't
think I would've believed the story myself...`,

            story: `<p align="center" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">If I hadn't been
there in that same foxhole with Henry and Benny that day, I don't
think I would've believed the story myself... 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">This was back in
1941. The two of them came into our unit together. Benny was always
teased by the other guys for being so small and quiet, but Henry,
very large in stature, always stood up for him. When we were
separated into battalions, Henry begged the Superiors to let him be
in the same one as Benny. The Superiors allowed it, being that they
noticed how much more &quot;normal&quot; Benny was when Henry was
with him. Every now and then, Benny would tremble or get &quot;the
shakes&quot; is what I would call 'em, and Henry would hug him until
he stopped his bizarre behavior. Usually, someone like Benny wouldn't
be considered fit for the army, but America took whoever they could
at the time. If they could fire a weapon and get their asses out of
harm's way quick enough, that was sufficient. The other soldiers
taunted them by calling them lovers, but Henry always kept a cool
head, leading Benny to not take things to heart. 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Whenever things got
bad on the battlefield, Henry would protect Benny like a child; it
was to the point where Henry would cover Benny's ears when the bombs
went off in the distance or when one of us threw a grenade... But,
there was that one day I'll never forget: seven of us were all
huddled together in one of the biggest foxholes I think I'd ever
helped dig, and we were completely outnumbered; bombs started falling
all around us, and bullets were flying through the air, some of them
kicking up some serious dirt and the others hitting some of our
soldiers, our brothers. I remember seeing Benny curled up in the
deepest part of the foxhole, starting to get the shakes while he held
his hands over his ears. Henry was too busy up front, letting off
rounds at those Nazi bastards, to check on his friend. Benny's
shaking got worse, and for the first time, I heard his voice; he
started yelling Henry's name out. 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">From the moment he
screamed his friend's name, all the explosions and commotion outside
seemed to fade. The explosions sounded muffled almost. Henry dropped
his rifle and ran over to Benny, kneeling next to him. &quot;It's
okay, Benny; just focus. You're not hurting anyone. Just focus on the
bombs and the bullets.&quot; The other soldiers at the front of the
foxhole stopped firing their weapons, too. One soldier took his
helmet off and stared a Mark 1 General Purpose Bomb right in the nose
as it headed straight for our foxhole; it exploded only 20 feet from
us, the fire and debris of the bomb encircling us, but not touching
us; we couldn't even feel the heat from it. 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Suddenly, our
foxhole got tighter as other soldiers ran inside. When I asked what
the hell was going on, one soldier stuttered out, &quot;You-you
t-tell me!&quot; and pointed outside. I finally got the guts to go
and see why we hadn't died yet, and when I looked outside, the entire
platoon was standing outside of their bombed foxholes, ours being the
only one not destroyed. Before I could scream at them for being so
exposed, another bomb went off above their heads, the explosion
behaving as if there were an invisible shield around us. 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Bullets flew at us,
but they bounced off whatever was protecting us. To me, it looked
like a glass dome was stopping everything that could've killed us
that day, but then I quickly returned to the foxhole and saw Benny
standing up, his eyes glowing a bright white hue and his hand
stretched upward. I stared in complete awe, scared and grateful at
the thought that Benny was the one protecting us the entire time.
Benny closed his hand into a fist at one point, and I heard a massive
bomb go off above us. &quot;The Atomic Bomb! It just malfunctioned!
Right over us!&quot;, a soldier outside screamed out. I pulled my
eyes away from Benny and ran outside to catch everything else he was
doing. A few more bombs came speeding toward us, but they turned up
and around, hitting the Nazi planes they came from. 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Benny used whatever
gifts he had, exhausting his body and mind until the explosions had
stopped. When everything was over, Benny's legs gave out, and he fell
over, but the soldiers closest to him caught him. Henry hugged Benny
as he was carried outside of the foxhole, his tears wetting Benny's
dog tags and camouflaged uniform. The soldiers lay Benny down on the
soft dirt; Henry wiped his face of the blood that came out of his
nose. &quot;Thank you, little brother. Thank you.&quot; Henry
crouched over Benny's dead body and hugged him and kissed him as the
other soldiers removed their helmets out of respect and honor for
Benny. 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">A few weeks after
Benny's funeral, in which he was awarded the Soldier's Medal, the
Medal of Honor, and the Purple Heart, I had the chance to talk with
Henry about Benny. Henry told me that Benny joined the army with him
because their parents wanted him to protect Henry, which was
something none of us other soldiers concluded when we first met the
two. Benny knew there was a possibility of death if he overexerted
himself, but he loved his brother and his country, so it was a small
burden to bear for him. I never found out what made Benny so
powerful; I was just thankful that he did what he did that day in
that foxhole.</p>`

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Chuck carefully
touched the intense flame of his blowtorch against a pair of
handcuffs, the sparks flying up at his safety goggles. His police
badge shimmered on his blue uniform shirt as it hung from a coat
rack. He turned the spitting fire off, and removed his goggles,
blowing on the two, hot steel circles. 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><span style="background: #ffffff">His
wife, Janet, entered the garage and leaned against the door frame.
&quot;How far along are you?&quot; Chuck looked over his shoulder.
&quot;I'm done.&quot; He picked up his high-tech handcuffs and handed
them to Janet. &quot;They're much bulkier than the standard cuffs.&quot;
Chuck nodded. &quot;Yep. How else am I gonna fit a bomb-proof
bodysuit in 'em?&quot; Janet sighed heavily. &quot;I just wish the
rest of the department thought this idea was as great as <i>I</i>
do.&quot; Chuck kissed Janet on the cheek. &quot;Hey, if they're not
worried about headshots and dying, that's on them, but <i>I'm</i> not
taking any chances with those animals out there.&quot; </span>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Night fell. Chuck
and Doug patrolled a predominantly black and Latino neighborhood. 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">&quot;Okay, so we
have warrants for Victor Palacios and his crew for armed robbery and
first-degree murder. The next street is where they live.&quot; Chuck
nodded his head, turning the undercover Dodge Charger onto the
perpendicular road. The two white officers pulled up to a yard full
of people partying outside. 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Doug stepped out of
the vehicle, his bulletproof vest on, and shouted over the loud
music. &quot;Any of you know the whereabouts of Victor Palacios?&quot;
The blacks and latinos continued partying, some of them snickering at
the police officer. &quot;No? No one knows Victor? How about Marcus
Dunn?&quot; Some of the people shook their heads and took more shots
of tequila. &quot;If no one knows the whereabouts of these two men,
I'm gonna have to shut this party down and search the premises.&quot;
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">One black guy
stepped out of the crowd. &quot;Look, cracka, we all just tryna have
a good time. Why don't you get the fuck outta here, man?&quot; 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Chuck stepped out of
the car, placing his hand on his gun. &quot;Sir, we don't want any
trouble. We're just looking for Victor and Marcus; we know they're in
there.&quot; Chuck stepped closer to the man who was standing in
front of Doug. 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">He saw two black
teenaged boys through the crowd, one of them being pressured into
drinking a beer by their suspect, Marcus. 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Chuck suddenly took
his hand off his gun and placed his grip on Doug's shoulder. &quot;We
should go; tonight's not a good night to do this.&quot; 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Doug's face twisted
up in bewilderment. &quot;What? Why?&quot; 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Chuck gripped Doug's
arm. &quot;There are kids here. We should just go.&quot; 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Doug snatched away
from Chuck. &quot;I don't give a damn. We're here now, and-&quot; 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">&quot;Ay! Back up
off my cuz, popo!&quot; Another black guy jumped out of the crowd
with a gun and started firing. 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Both officers ducked
and rolled behind their car. 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Doug started
shooting back from over the trunk, and the crowd separated. More guys
pulled out their guns and fired tons of rounds as women screamed,
some of the people being hit by Doug and some struck with stray
bullets from the gang members. Chuck fired his weapon at the man who
shot first, instantly killing him. He looked up when the bullets
stopped for a second and saw the two boys lying on the ground. 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">He ducked down
behind the hood again. &quot;Shit!&quot; He got up and fired his
pistol, hitting two more gangsters. He knelt a second time, pulling
out his high-tech handcuffs. He cuffed one of his wrists. 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">A sound of
whimpering came from the front yard, and Chuck peeked over the hood
again. The two boys slowly lifted their heads, both of them with
tears rolling down their cheeks. 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Chuck exhaled in
relief with trembling in his breath. He ducked down once more and
looked at his cuffed wrist. &quot;Doug! Cover me!&quot; 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Doug looked over to
his partner. &quot;What?! You're going out there?! There's too many!&quot;
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">&quot;Just cover me
as long as you can!&quot; Chuck took the cuff off and ran out from
behind the car. Doug fired his weapon with precision, hitting those
who were a threat to Chuck. 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Chuck reached the
kids and grabbed the wrist of the older teen, putting his unique
cuffs on him. &quot;Hey! What are you doing? We didn't do nothin’!
You're gonna get shot!&quot; Chuck looked around at the guys firing
at Doug. &quot;I know. Just pull your hands apart.&quot; 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The kid looked back
at Chuck. &quot;What?!&quot; Chuck looked the kid in the eyes. &quot;Just
do it, and take your brother out of here.&quot; 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><span style="background: #ffffff">The
young teen pulled his arms in opposite directions, the two cuffs
disconnected from each other, and small sheets of steel folded out of
them until they covered the entire frame of the boy. The younger teen
looked at his brother in awe. &quot;Y-you look like <i>Iron-Man</i>.&quot;
The boy looked down at his metallic hands. </span>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Chuck shoved the boy
on the shoulder. &quot;Get outta here, now!&quot; The kid picked up
his brother with ease. Chuck pulled a gun from his leg and started
firing at the gangsters again. &quot;Just start running!&quot;
Bullets bounced off the metallic suit. The boy did as Chuck said, and
the two boys sped off, breaking the sound barrier. 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Chuck looked at his
suit's ability in awe. A bullet hit him in the neck, and Chuck fell
to the ground.

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Doug took a bullet
in the eye and fell by the car tires.

showed up, laying waste to the remaining gunmen.

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><span style="background: #ffffff">A
week passed. The two teen boys rang the doorbell of Chuck's house.
Janet answered the door. The older teen held the high-tech cuffs out
toward her. &quot;We think these belong to you. Your husband saved
our lives.&quot; Janet teared up as she took the cuffs from the boys.
&quot;Thank you... I thought they malfunctioned or he didn't get the
chance to use 'em or... Thank you.&quot; The boys started to walk
away; Janet called out to them. &quot;Hey!” Chuck’s wife tossed
the handcuffs back to the elder brother. “You keep 'em. You might
need ‘em; it's what Chuck would have wanted.&quot; The brothers
smiled softly at Janet, nodding to her as she watched them depart
from her driveway.</span></p>`

pounded on the bathroom door as it muffled the sounds of sniffling

edge. The pounding became more aggressive. “Yo, ‘Dre, it ain’t

the inside. Sam looked over his shoulder. “Don’t be mad at </FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><I>me</I></FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>,

walked down the stairs of the apartment and froze. A dozen residents
stood in the parking lot, looking up at the apartment building next
to Sam’s. He slowly walked toward one of the neighbors and tapped a
middle-aged man on the shoulder. The man jumped. Sam jumped in
response. “Sorry, bro. What the hell are you guys doing?” The man
was pale in the face. He looked back to the apartment and pointed at
a floor of open doors. “M-Ms. Johnson just passed away a few
minutes ago... We knew she was gonna go sometime soon... but
s-something happened to her after that... She entered our homes
and-and... I can’t explain it...” Sam looked up at the building
and saw Ms. Johnson appear in a doorway, walking in a bizarre,
stumbling fashion, blood covering her mouth and her baby blue
nightgown, the tubes from her oxygen tank dangling in front of her
crimson-stained teeth. Her veins protruded all over from under her
abnormal, gray skin. </FONT></FONT>

A woman screamed up to her changed, ten-year-old daughter before
collapsing to her knees in tears. The young girl and the rest of the
strange residents howled like Ms. Johnson and began jumping over the
rails of the second floor, some of them gripping the walls and
rapidly descending. Three of the gray people hit the ground first and
charged at the gawking residents, sinking their teeth into their
living skin. Sam’s eyes widened. “Oh, </FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><I>hell</I></FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The

Eric got off his bed, placing his phone on his pillow. The phone
buzzed as the screen lit up with a call from Sam. Eric stood at the
bathroom door with a key in his hand. “Alright, ‘Dre, I’m
coming in. This is gettin’ outta hand, bro.” Eric unlocked the
door and twisted the doorknob. A gray Andre with protruding veins
fell on top of him, a rope looped tightly around his neck, a broken
shower pipe connected to the other end of it. Andre let out a
piercing screech before biting into Eric’s shoulder. </FONT></FONT>

Andre lunged at Sam, pinning him to the floor. Eric rose to his feet
in his new, gray skin, running past the two roommates and crashing
through the kitchen window. Andre sank his teeth into Sam. Eric flung
himself over the railing and hit the bottom floor sidewalk with
undead feet. He ran toward the feeding frenzy of residential victims
as Sam’s dark brown skin faded to gray.</FONT></FONT></P>`

had been working on a formula in my personal time, something to
improve my life in multiple ways. I was going to show my colleagues
how great of a scientist I was and how MY mind held science’s most
coveted phenomenon. I called the drug, “Duplican”. I used a
gerbil as my lab rat. When I finally perfected it, I dripped the
formula into the gerbil’s food; the little guy ate it, and within
minutes, there were two gerbils, each looking like the other in every
way! At first, the clone showed signs of disorientation; it wouldn’t
join the original gerbil for food; it seemed lost. The clone wandered
around the cage for at least a few hours before it finally joined the
original gerbil in a nap. After that, both gerbils interacted with
each other normally, sometimes mirroring what each other did, proving
that the same mind had also been cloned.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

got home, I could spend time with my kids while she slept. It’d be

for Duplican to work on someone my size. I couldn’t figure it out,

remember slapping that man in the face and pounding against his chest
