      story: `        Samuel pounded on the bathroom door as it muffled the sounds of sniffling from inside. “C’mon man, I gotta take a pee! You wanna cry, go in your room!” Andre sat on the closed toilet seat with his face buried in his hands, a looped rope dangling over the bathtub’s edge. The pounding became more aggressive. “Yo, ‘Dre, it ain’t like you died or somethin’, man!” Eric stuck his head out of his room door, his voice at a whisper. “Sam, just chill, man. Here, use my bathroom.” Eric opened his door wider. Sam shook his head and entered. “Why’s he trippin’ over some girl anyway? She wasn’t even that cute. If a girl ever dumped me, I’d be celebrating my freedom.” Eric rolled his eyes. “Not everyone’s like you, Sam. Give him some time to think things over.” Sam carelessly waved his hand at his roommate. “Whatever.” 

            Sam zipped himself up and walked toward the front door. A loud thud sounded from the locked bathroom, and then pounding on the door from the inside. Sam looked over his shoulder. “Don’t be mad at ME, ‘Dre. You’re the one lettin’ this girl keep you down.” The loud banging persisted. Sam rolled his eyes and walked out the door. 
            
            He walked down the stairs of the apartment and froze. A dozen residents stood in the parking lot, looking up at the apartment building next to Sam’s. He slowly walked toward one of the neighbors and tapped a middle-aged man on the shoulder. The man jumped. Sam jumped in response. “Sorry, bro. What the hell are you guys doing?” The man was pale in the face. He looked back to the apartment and pointed at a floor of open doors. “M-Ms. Johnson just passed away a few minutes ago... We knew she was gonna go sometime soon... but s-something happened to her after that... She entered our homes and-and... I can’t explain it...” Sam looked up at the building and saw Ms. Johnson appear in a doorway, walking in a bizarre, stumbling fashion, blood covering her mouth and her baby blue nightgown, the tubes from her oxygen tank dangling in front of her crimson-stained teeth. Her veins protruded all over from under her gray skin. 
            
            The crowd below gasped, some whimpering sympathetically. She let out a haunting screech. Other gray-skinned residents emerged in the open doorways, deep bite marks in their necks and forearms. “Gracie!” A woman screamed up to her changed, 10-year-old daughter before collapsing to her knees in tears. The young girl and the rest of the strange residents howled like Ms. Johnson and began jumping over the rails of the second floor, some of them gripping the walls and rapidly descending. Three of the gray people hit the ground and charged at the gawking residents, sinking their teeth into their living skin. Sam’s eyes widened. “Oh, hell no.” He scurried back up the stairs of his building. 
            
            The pounding continued on the bathroom door inside Sam’s apartment. Eric got off his bed, placing his phone on his pillow. The phone buzzed as the screen lit up with a call from Sam. Eric stood at the bathroom door with a key in his hand. “Alright, ‘Dre, I’m coming in. This is gettin’ outta hand, bro.” Eric unlocked the door and twisted the doorknob. A gray Andre with protruding veins fell on top of him, a rope looped tightly around his neck, a broken shower pipe connected to the other end of it. Andre let out a piercing screech before biting into Eric’s shoulder. 
            
            Sam reached his apartment door and burst inside, shutting and locking the door behind him. “You wouldn’t BELIEVE what I just-“ Sam turned and faced a red-mouthed Andre, his eyes looking to the noose around his neck. “No... You didn’t, ‘Dre...” Andre lunged at Sam, pinning him to the floor. Eric rose to his feet in his new, gray skin, running past the two roommates and crashing through the window. Andre sank his teeth into Sam. Eric flung himself over the railing and hit the bottom floor sidewalk with undead feet. He ran toward the feeding frenzy of residential victims as Sam’s dark brown skin faded to gray.

      story: `  Dark, curly hair. Full lips. Olive skin. A mole on the right side of my face. That’s how most of my colleagues described me on a day to day basis when anyone needed to locate me... or identify me for a gossip session; no one bothered to remember my name. I was a scientist, just like everyone else in that corporation, but all anyone there could see was the older, single mom Latina whose butt stuck out awkwardly from under her white lab coat. 

      It took me a little longer to graduate college. I got pregnant by my high school sweetheart; we were both juniors in college. He was overjoyed by the big news, but he also abandoned me once we found out I was carrying twins. One child, he could deal with, but two meant that he was no longer in love. I struggled, caring for Tomás and Gemela, but I got my degree in experimental medical science, and I was determined to make a name for myself in that field; Marisol Hernandez was going to be somebody... until I lost my son. Tomás was never too fond of fires. 
      
      I was trapped around fresh faces in my line of work; youngsters just coming out of school, employees who were sure to get promotions before me because their young minds were sure to hold the most groundbreaking secrets in science, and I might as well have retired my lab coat and put on a janitor’s jumper. I was intelligent, but no one cared. I was tired from the single mom life and holding down a full-time career; LESS than no one cared about that part. 
      
      I had been working on a formula in my personal time, something to improve my life in multiple ways. I was going to show my colleagues how great of a scientist I was and how MY mind held science’s most coveted phenomenon. I called the drug, “Duplican”. I used a gerbil as my lab rat. When I finally perfected it, I dripped the formula into the gerbil’s food; the little guy ate it, and within minutes, there were two gerbils, each looking like the other in every way! At first, the clone showed signs of disorientation; it wouldn’t join the original gerbil for food; it seemed lost. The clone wandered around the cage for at least a few hours before it finally joined the original gerbil in a nap. After that, both gerbils interacted with each other normally, sometimes mirroring what each other did, proving that the same mind had also been cloned. 
      
      I decided Duplican was ready for human testing; of course, I used myself as the experiment. I was so pumped to become twice the Marisol and finally get some sleep! One of me could go to work while the other me stayed home and slept during the day. When the other Marisol got home, I could spend time with my kids while she slept. It’d be perfect! 
      
      I drank a small glass of the formula; I was much bigger than a gerbil. I waited, and I waited. For six days, I would wake up, hoping to be laying next to my clone, but nothing happened. According to my calculations with the gerbil, it was only supposed to take 24 hours for Duplican to work on someone my size. I couldn’t figure it out, and I was distraught about it. 
      
      This drug was supposed to change my life and make me a world renowned scientist! I was waiting for the day to come where my clone and I would walk into work together and just leave everyone in awe. I especially wanted this to be the best field trip my kids would ever experience. Their kindergarten class was scheduled to visit our labs, and the day they came to see Mommy at work was gonna be the day their whole class saw two of me! The formula’s shortcomings made that impossible, though. 
      
      I remember coming to work that day, more miserable than I’d ever been in that place. My kids were just gonna come in and see their mother working an ordinary job, nothing inspiring; just some goggles, rubber gloves, and weird shaped containers with colored water in them. That day wasn’t ordinary, though. There was an accident on an upper level of the building, and a fire was spreading rapidly. My kids were already in the building with their class, but they hadn’t visited my working quarters yet. I rushed out of my lab the moment I heard news of the incident; I had to make sure my kids were safe. 
      
      The black smoke was rising, and the fire caught hold of the walls on my floor. I finally saw a group of children huddled in the middle of the hallway, their teacher passed out on the floor. Tile and support beams had fallen around them, trapping them in their standing place. I saw Gemela and rushed to her. I jumped over one of the burning beams and picked up my daughter. I hugged her and asked her where her brother was. She pointed in the direction I had just come from. I only saw black smoke and fire. “He was crying a lot, Mommy. Then, he ran that way.” 
      
      A window broke open near us, and a firefighter crawled inside. He ushered the children and the staff out the window and down the ladder. He lifted the passed out teacher over his shoulder as I joined him at the window, Gemela still in my arms. Gemela began to crawl down the ladder to safety. The firefighter ushered me to go next. “My son is still in here!” The firefighter pulled his oxygen mask off. “This place is coming down! We have to evacuate now! Your son is probably outside! No one else is on this floor!” I cried, hoping the firefighter was right. I exited the window, looking around for Tomás on every floor, every step down that ladder. 
      
      When we got to safety, I grabbed Gemela by the hand, and we took off looking for Tomás. He wasn’t in any of the groups that were rescued. I demanded an explanation from one of the firefighters. “One of your guys told me that no one else was on my floor! I’ve searched every party! Where is my son?! Where is my son?!” I remember slapping that man in the face and pounding against his chest until I collapsed to the ground. I felt his gloved hand rest lightly on my shoulder. “I’m sorry. We saved everyone we could.” My daughter knelt next to me and did her best to comfort me with her small, but loving voice. “I love you, Mommy. I’m sorry.” I tried my best to be strong for Gemela, but I had just lost my son, her other half. 
      
      “Dr. Hernandez?” Another firefighter walked on the scene with a clipboard in his hand. I was confused that he knew my name. I had never seen him before, and no one ever bothered to remember my name. All I could mutter was, “What?” The firefighter smiled at me. “I can see you found your daughter, too... Where’d your son run off to?” 
      
      I must’ve looked like an idiot because I was completely lost. The firefighter gave me a perplexed look. “I just talked to you ten minutes ago, and you had your son with you.” The firefighter looked down at his notepad. “Tomás Hernandez, right? Where is he?” Tears rolled down my face. I couldn’t stop myself from crying tears of joy! The formula had worked! At some point during the fire, my clone must’ve emerged out of me and went to find my little boy. The firefighter asked me if everything was okay, and I just nodded and smiled through my tears, embracing my little girl. I just whispered through my whimpering, “You hear that, baby? Tomás is fine! Your brother is fine, baby!” 
      
      A couple days passed, and there was no sign of my son or my clone. I worried every minute of every day, anxious to make a missing persons report, but I had to trust in my experiment. I also had to come to the reality that I wasn’t ready to reveal my successful formula. With that kind of attention, I knew I would be away from my kids even more, and with my clone’s help, and all of us keeping everything a secret, I had so much more time to spend with the people who mattered the most to me. 
      
      Gemela asked me at least a dozen times between those two days when Tomás was coming home. I always answered, “Soon, sweetheart”, with a big grin on my face. I knew that my clone was still me, so I trusted her, and I also knew that my clone had become disoriented, temporarily lost, just like the gerbil duplicate. It was only a matter of time before she remembered her way home with my son. 
      
      I’ll never forget that day Tomás came back to us: the house was quiet; Gemela was taking her after school nap; the gerbils were resting in their cage next to each other; the doorbell rang. I walked swiftly to the door and swung it open. An olive-skinned, curly- and dark-haired Latina with full lips and a mole on the right side of her face was standing in my doorway, looking down lovingly at my son, holding his little hand, soot staining both his little school clothes and her white lab coat.
