                                            <p> Samuel pounded on the bathroom door as it muffled the sounds of sniffling from
                                                inside. “C’mon man, I gotta take a pee! You wanna cry, go in your room!”
                                                Andre sat on the closed toilet seat with his face buried in his hands, a
                                                looped rope dangling over the bathtub’s edge. The pounding became more aggressive.
                                                “Yo, ‘Dre, it ain’t like you died or somethin’, man!” Eric stuck his head
                                                out of his room door, his voice at a whisper. “Sam, just chill, man. Here,
                                                use my bathroom.” Eric opened his door wider. Sam shook his head and entered.
                                                “Why’s he trippin’ over some girl anyway? She wasn’t even that cute. If a
                                                girl ever dumped me, I’d be celebrating my freedom.” Eric rolled his eyes.
                                                “Not everyone’s like you, Sam. Give him some time to think things over.”
                                                Sam carelessly waved his hand at his roommate. “Whatever.” Sam zipped himself
                                                up and walked toward the front door. A loud thud sounded from the locked
                                                bathroom, and then pounding on the door from the inside. Sam looked over
                                                his shoulder. “Don’t be mad at ME, ‘Dre. You’re the one lettin’ this girl
                                                keep you down.” The loud banging persisted. Sam rolled his eyes and walked
                                                out the door. He walked down the stairs of the apartment and froze. A dozen
                                                residents stood in the parking lot, looking up at the apartment building
                                                next to Sam’s. He slowly walked toward one of the neighbors and tapped a
                                                middle-aged man on the shoulder. The man jumped. Sam jumped in response.
                                                “Sorry, bro. What the hell are you guys doing?” The man was pale in the face.
                                                He looked back to the apartment and pointed at a floor of open doors. “M-Ms.
                                                Johnson just passed away a few minutes ago... We knew she was gonna go sometime
                                                soon... but s-something happened to her after that... She entered our homes
                                                and-and... I can’t explain it...” Sam looked up at the building and saw Ms.
                                                Johnson appear in a doorway, walking in a bizarre, stumbling fashion, blood
                                                covering her mouth and her baby blue nightgown, the tubes from her oxygen
                                                tank dangling in front of her crimson-stained teeth. Her veins protruded
                                                all over from under her gray skin. The crowd below gasped, some whimpering
                                                sympathetically. She let out a haunting screech. Other gray-skinned residents
                                                emerged in the open doorways, deep bite marks in their necks and forearms.
                                                “Gracie!” A woman screamed up to her changed, 10-year-old daughter before
                                                collapsing to her knees in tears. The young girl and the rest of the strange
                                                residents howled like Ms. Johnson and began jumping over the rails of the
                                                second floor, some of them gripping the walls and rapidly descending. Three
                                                of the gray people hit the ground and charged at the gawking residents, sinking
                                                their teeth into their living skin. Sam’s eyes widened. “Oh, hell no.” He
                                                scurried back up the stairs of his building. The pounding continued on the
                                                bathroom door inside Sam’s apartment. Eric got off his bed, placing his phone
                                                on his pillow. The phone buzzed as the screen lit up with a call from Sam.
                                                Eric stood at the bathroom door with a key in his hand. “Alright, ‘Dre, I’m
                                                coming in. This is gettin’ outta hand, bro.” Eric unlocked the door and twisted
                                                the doorknob. A gray Andre with protruding veins fell on top of him, a rope
                                                looped tightly around his neck, a broken shower pipe connected to the other
                                                end of it. Andre let out a piercing screech before biting into Eric’s shoulder.
                                                Sam reached his apartment door and burst inside, shutting and locking the
                                                door behind him. “You wouldn’t BELIEVE what I just-“ Sam turned and faced
                                                a red-mouthed Andre, his eyes looking to the noose around his neck. “No...
                                                You didn’t, ‘Dre...” Andre lunged at Sam, pinning him to the floor. Eric
                                                rose to his feet in his new, gray skin, running past the two roommates and
                                                crashing through the window. Andre sank his teeth into Sam. Eric flung himself
                                                over the railing and hit the bottom floor sidewalk with undead feet. He ran
                                                toward the feeding frenzy of residential victims as Sam’s dark brown skin
                                                faded to gray.
